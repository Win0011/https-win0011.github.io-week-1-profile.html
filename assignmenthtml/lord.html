        who served as Governor of Hong Kong, Governor of Northern Nigeria
        Protectorate, Governor of Southern Nigeria Protectorate, and

        Lugard laid the foundations of British rule in the North, first
        establishing British sovereignty by conquest of the Moslem states which
        had resisted alien domination and then by developing the forms of
        administration whereby the British would rule
