          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is
          one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
          CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side
          for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is primarily used for web development. It is a dynamic,
          client-side scripting language that can be embedded in web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is commonly used for client-side scripting in web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a JavaScript example:</p>
        <code> function greet() { console.log('Hello, world!'); } </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="HTML">
        <header>HTML</header>
        <p>
          The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines
          the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
          technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages
          such as JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a simple HTML example:</p>
        <code>
          <html>
            <head>
              <title>My Web Page</title>
            </head>
            <body>
              <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
              <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
            </body>
          </html>
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="CSS">
        <header>CSS</header>
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing
          the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
          HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
          alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>And here's a basic CSS example to style page:</p>
        <code> h1 { color: blue; } p { font-size: 16px; } </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Tailwind_CSS">
        <header>Tailwind CSS</header>
        <p>
          Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this
          library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does
          not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as
          buttons or tables.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a simple Tailwind CSS example:</p>
        <code>
          <body>
            <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">
              <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Hello, Tailwind CSS!</h1>
            </div>
          </body>
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="React">
        <header>React</header>
        <p>
          React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
          building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta
          and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be
          used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications
          with frameworks like Next.js.
        </p>
        <p>Here's how to start a React project:</p>
        <p>
          First, create a new React app using Create React App (a popular tool
          for quickly setting up a React project):
        </p>
        <code> npx create-react-app my-react-app cd my-react-app </code>
        <!-- Replace my-react-app with your desired project name. -->
        <p>
          Now, open the project in your code editor. In the src directory,
          you'll find a file called App.js. Replace its content with the
          following example:
        </p>
        <code>
          import React from 'react'; function App() { return (
          <div>
            <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
            <p>This is a basic React example.</p>
          </div>
          ); } export default App;
        </code>
        <p>Now, to see your React app in action, open your terminal and run:</p>
        <code>npm run dev</code>
        <p>
          This will start the development server, and you can access your React
          app in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. You should see
          "Hello, React!" displayed on the page.
